# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I organized the affair, member, and organization into their own classes. I used the manager class for the affair manager and created lists of each class within it. I determined the classes to define by analyzing the assignment document for nouns that could represent a potential object.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Yes. I looked at the documentation for typescript, and watched a few youtube videos on object oriented programming in typescript.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 7-8


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 6-7


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I've never used typescript or javascript before, so the syntax took some getting used to.
