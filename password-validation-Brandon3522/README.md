# Setup and Review

This repo contains code for the password validator. The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

## Did you find the JavaScript Learning Tutor useful? If so, what about the tool made it useful? If not, why not?
> Yes. Instructions on how to use the typescript compiler to convert the typescript source code to javascript helped me.


## Do you have any suggestions on how the JavaScript Learning Tutor might be improved?
> No.


## Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!).
> I read the node.js docummentation for the readline module. I aslo watched a youtube tutorial on how to use the readline module.


## Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
> 4-6. I had trouble getting the typescript compiler to work in visual studio 2019. Eventually I gave up and downloaded visual studio code. Once I did that I was able to get the compiler to work.


## On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment?
> 4-5.


## Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better?
> Yes. I had some trouble understanding how to use the readline module and also getting my function to call itself recursively. Once I got past that the assignment was pretty straightforward.
